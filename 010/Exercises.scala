// You should work with the file by following the associated exercise sheet
// (available in PDF from the course website).
//
// The file is meant to be compiled as follows:
//
// scalac Exercises.scala
//
// or
//
// fsc Exercises.scala
//
// To run the compiled file do "scala Exercises"
//
// To load the file int the REPL start the 'scala' interpreter and issue the
// command ':load Exercises.scala'. Now you can interactively experiment with
// your code.
//
// Continue solving exercises in the order presented in the PDF file. Large
// parts of the file are commented in order to make sure that the exercise
// compiles.  Uncomment and complete fragments as you proceed.  The file shall
// always compile and run after you are done with each exercise (if you do them
// in order).  Please compile and test frequently.

// The extension of App allows writing statements at class top level (the so
// called default constructor). For App objects they will be executed as if they
// were placed in the main method in Java.

	// Only the branch that returns 1 is in tail position. The other branches modify the return value and are therefore not in tail position.
	// Large values of n will result in roughly n stack frames. It is possible to imagine scenarios where this could be problematic.
	// For example if you are interested in computing a large power of a number very close to 1.

  // The above assertions should pass when you call "scala Exercises".

  // The following one should fail. Uncomment to check that assert works as
  // expected:
  //
  // assert (power (1.0, 42) == 2.0, "Failed assertion")
